              <span style="font-size: 25px;color: #000;">The While Statement</span><br><br>
              The simplest of all looping structure in C is the while statement. The
general format of the while statement is:
<br>Initialization;
       <br> <br>      while (test condition)
            <br>  {
           
             <br> updation;
          <br>  }
          <br> <br> Here the given test condition is evaluated and if the
condition is true then the body of the loop is executed. After the
execution of the body, the test condition is once again evaluated and
if it is true, the body is executed once again. This process of repeated
execution of the body continues until the test condition finally
becomes false and the control is transferred out of the loop. On exit,
the program continues with the statements immediately after the
body of the loop. The body of the loop may have one or more
statements. The braces are needed only if the body contained two
are more statements
<br>
<br>In the below program the looping concept is used to generate n natural numbers. Here n and I are declared as integer variables and I is initialized to value zero. A message is given to the user to enter the natural number till where he wants to generate the numbers. The entered number is read and stored by the scanf statement. The while loop then checks whether the value of I is less than n i.e., the user entered number if it is true then the control enters the loop body and prints the value of I using the
printf statement and increments the value of I to the next natural number this process repeats till the value of I becomes equal to or greater than the number given by the user.

              <span style="font-size: 25px;color: #000;">The Do while statement
</span><br><br>
           The do while loop is also a kind of loop, which is similar to the while loop in contrast to while loop, the do while loop tests at the bottom of the loop after executing the body of the loop. Since the body of the loop is executed first and then the loop condition is checked we can be assured that the body of the loop is executed at least once.
<br><br>Here the statement is executed, then expression is evaluated. If the condition expression is true then the body is executed again and this process continues till the conditional expression becomes false. When the expression becomes false. When the expression becomes false the loop terminates.
<br><br>To realize the usefulness of the do while construct consider the following problem. The user must be prompted to press Y or N. In reality the user can press any key other than y or n. IN such case the message must be shown again and the user should be allowed to enter one of the two keys, clearly this is a loop construct. Also it has to be executed at least once. The following program illustrates the solution.

              When the control enters for loop the variables used in for loop is initialized with the starting value such as I=0,count=0. The value which was initialized is then checked with the given test condition. The test condition is a relational expression, such as I < 5 that checks whether the given condition is satisfied or not if the given condition is satisfied the control enters the body of the loop or else it will exit the loop. The body of the loop is entered only if the test condition is satisfied and after the completion of the execution of the loop the control is transferred back to the increment part of the loop. The control variable is incremented using an assignment statement such as I=I+1 or simply I++ and the new value of the control variable is again tested to check whether it satisfies the loop condition. If the value of the control variable satisfies then the body of the loop is again executed. The process goes on till the control variable fails to satisfy the condition.

            <h2>You already know a language. Maybe you learned it in school or probably learn it out of curiosity.</h2>
            <h3>Every single one of those jobs you heard about was in one way or the other related to computer programming. Here’s the harsh truth.</h3>
            <p>
             If you have just stepped into college. which means you are still a young youth like all others, wishing to taste success in life. But you are confused.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are talking about a decent level of knowledge in programming with a sound understanding of all the basic principles and concepts. If you fall into this category, We would suggest you continue with the language, whichever it might be.
             <br>You do not wish to go hardcore into programming but would like to know at least a language that could help you develop some software in future.This might be the case if you are pursuing engineering in some other branch other than Computer Science. You do not intend to foray into the IT field but knowledge of a language is always beneficiary.<br>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 15px;" class="box featured wow fadeInUp">
            <p>The only difference being you’d like to learn a programming language to make a website of your own or probably want to get into App Development. This is very specific in the case you have already figured out that this is what you wish to do. Java is the language to pick up and go within this case. The reason is simple; Java is a highly object-oriented language that is immensely effective in the case of Web Development and App Development.
This might be the most important one. This scenario is for the cases wherein you are really interested in what goes inside of being a good programmer. You wish to be well versed with all the theoretical knowledge, not only the application based. In such cases, We will suggest C/C++. It is harder than other languages that we have mentioned here and you will have to spend a significant amount of time learning it. But, here is the thing. Once you manage to learn it, you will be having in-depth knowledge of programming as a skill and why do we do the things we do. There are numerous other benefits as well; such as C/C++ has a much faster processing time and is the best choice if you wish to get into competitive coding.</p><br>
            Do figure out which category do you belong to and begin your journey to be a great programmer. No matter which language you pick up, just stick to it and don’t abandon it midway. Devote your time and energy to it and see it showering you with success.
